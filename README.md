# Personal Portfio 4: Unit Testing

In this repositiory you will find the project files for my research in unit test and automating them using github actions.
The main branch only holds the readme file the since there are three projects hosted in this repository: [Getting Started](https://github.com/mathias-bevers/term2.4-personal-portfolio/tree/getting-started), [Minesweeper](https://github.com/mathias-bevers/term2.4-personal-portfolio/tree/minesweeper), and [Advent Of Code Framework](https://github.com/mathias-bevers/term2.4-personal-portfolio/tree/aoc).
