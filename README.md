# Personal Portfio 4: Unit Testing

In this repositiory you will find the project files for my research in unit test and automating them using github actions.
The main branch only holds the readme file the since there are three projects hosted in this repository: [Getting Started](https://github.com/mathias-bevers/term2.4-personal-portfolio/tree/getting-started), [Minesweeper](https://github.com/mathias-bevers/term2.4-personal-portfolio/tree/minesweeper), and [Advent Of Code Framework](https://github.com/mathias-bevers/term2.4-personal-portfolio/tree/aoc).

## Getting Started

This branch holds project which was made while I followed the ["C# Unit Testing - Full Course - Write Unit Tests in C# like a pro!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m863B7Eb6I4) video. It contains the basics of unit testing with a few samples.
